## About Mod

A collection of tools to make using gear presets better.

### Auto Save Gear Presets

Each time that you begin to enter a raid, the game will auto save a gear preset (by default named "Last Kit") containing the gear that you have on you.

### Partial Gear Presets

You can now select what slots a gear preset will overwrite. Presets with slots that are toggled to "ignore", will leave any gear that you have on you in place.

Adjust slots by clicking on them in the gear presets screen, like so:
